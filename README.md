# Kixel-Creator
A fun web-based app for creating 32x32 pixel art images, which are used for many things on Gravity Break. The Kixel Creator uses Phaser CE v.2.20.0.

If you want to contribute, we're always looking for new clear animations, fun details, and easter eggs. Also, a secret way to switch between music tracks would be welcome.
